NAME
    Email::MIME::Kit::Renderer::MicroMason - Render parts of your mail with
    Text::MicroMason

VERSION
    version 1.21

SYNOPSIS
    To use MicroMason in your mkit use something like:

        {
          "renderer": "MicroMason",
          "header": [
            { "From": "WY Corp <noreplies@wy.example.com" },
            { "To": "<% $ARGS{recruit}->email %>" },
            { "Subject": "Welcome aboard, <% ARGS{recruit}->name %>" }
          ],
          "alternatives": [
            { "type": "text/plain", "path": "body.txt" },
             {
              "type": "text/html",
              "path": "body.html",
              "container_type": "multipart/related",
              "attachments": [ { "type": "image/jpeg", "path": "logo.jpg" } ]
            }
          ]
        }

    Then in your email templates (body.txt and body.html) you can do:

        <%args>
        $recruit
        $cid_for
        </%args>

        <& "../includes/header.msn", %ARGS &>

        <p>
        Dear <% $recruit->name %>,
        </p>

        <p>
        Welcome to WY Corp.
        </p>

        <& "../includes/footer.msn", %ARGS &>

    EMK::Renderer::MicroMason will try to make any components included with
    <& ... &> relative to the mkit directory.

DESCRIPTION
    This renderer for Email::MIME::Kit uses Text::MicroMason to enable you
    to write your mkits using basic Mason syntax. See
    Text::MicroMason::HTMLMason for details on the syntax.

    This is based on Text::MicroMason rather than the full blown HTML::Mason
    because HTML::Mason is focused on directories and files and
    Email::MIME::Kit prefers to work with strings. Text::MicroMason
    accommodates this and is a bit smaller than it's big brother.

  METHODS
    render()
            render( $content_ref, $stash )

        Called by Email::MIME::Kit::Renderer to parse template strings
        ($content_ref) with Text::MicroMason and return a plain text string.

ACKNOWLEGEMENTS
    This is basically just Ricardo SIGNES' EMK::Renderer::TestRenderer with
    basic integration of Text::MicroMason. Thanks to Ricardo for the
    excellent EMK package.
