Change Log for Email::MIME::Kit::Renderer::MicroMason

1.21 - Tue Mar  5 15:19:44 EST 2013
    Applies rjbs' patch to uses EMK's kit_reader to read files, instead of
    chdir.

    "Changing to the kit dir before rendering is a bit of a dirty hack,
    but it works... as long as the kit's kitreader is Dir.  If you're
    using something more complicated, like KitReader::SWAK, it doesn't
    actually help.

    Instead of doing that, this commit adds a mixin to the micromason
    object, converting its reads of files-by-name into reads of kit
    contents.

    Admittedly, the way that the renderer is shoved into the mason
    object is also a dirty hack, but presumably it's one that can be
    corrected by someone more familiar with how micromason mixins are
    meant to work."

1.002 - Fri Oct 21 13:59:03 EDT 2011
    Added cleanup code in case mason->render dies
    - Always need to make sure we chdir back

1.02 - Sat Nov 28 09:37:33 2009
    Added support for the -Filters mixin
    Perform a chdir so any included components can be relative to mkit dir
